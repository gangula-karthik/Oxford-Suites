# hotel_project

## INTRODUCTION
During my first semester at Nanyang Polytechnic, my team and I undertook a project to create a website for a luxury hotel, which we named Oxford Suites. Each member of the team was responsible for a different aspect of the project: 
1. Karthik was responsible for the Dining Pages, Navbar (including extended navbar on homepage), Contact Us page, and hosting
2. Darren handled the Homepage, Offers Page, Footer, and Integration
3. Durrah was responsible for the Rooms Page and Payment page
4. Shing Hak worked on the Events Page
5. Xin Rui was responsible for the Facilities Page
